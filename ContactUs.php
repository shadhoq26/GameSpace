                <p> 
                I am aiming to create a game review website where people can 
                rank games based on their own enjoyment. You will be able to rank 
                videogames as well as be able to write reviews on games. 
                Furthermore, you can rate and view other people’s reviews making 
                it a more social experience. The users will be allowed to create an 
                account to display their favourite games and all the different 
                reviews of the games they have played. The aim is to create a 
                social, friendly environment for users to share their opinions and 
                comment on other user’s opinions on game of their choice.
